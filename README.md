# CGAN Experiments

## Roadmap

1. Setup basic GAN structure which will allow easy transition to CBRAIN data
2. Get pix2pix example data (day-to-night might be closest: float to float)
3. Reproduce pix2pix network
4. Test out different loss functions (Original and improved Wasserstein) and training parameters
5. Port CBRAIN network structure
6. Test on CBRAIN data
